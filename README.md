# Proof of Concept: Document Question-Answering App

This application is a proof of concept and is not yet production-ready. The primary idea is to allow users to take clear, well-lit pictures of documents, which the app will then convert to text. You can then ask questions about this text, and the TensorFlow.js MobileBERT QnA model will provide answers.

## Important Notes
- Ensure the documents are captured clearly and with adequate lighting for the best results.
- Currently, the app uses the MobileBERT pretrained model via TensorFlow.js. While it isn't the most optimal model available, it performs reasonably well for this purpose.
- Plans are in place to progressively enhance this application and improve its capabilities.
